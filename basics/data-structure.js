/**
 * * DATA TYPES
 * * Theres seven data types that are primitives:
 * * Boolean, true and false.
 * * null, for null value. (because javascript is case-sensitive, null is different with Null, NULL, and other variant).
 * * undefined. A top-level property whose value is not defined.
 * * Number. An integer or floating point number. Example: 42 or 3.14159
 * * BigInt. An Integer with arbitary precision. Example: 9007199254740992n.
 * * String. A sequence of characters that represent a text value. Example: "Hello World".
 * * Symbol. A data type whose instances are unique and immutable (new in ECMAScript 2015).
 * * Object. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that you script can perform.
